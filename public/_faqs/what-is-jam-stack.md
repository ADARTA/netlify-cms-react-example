title: What is the "JAM Stack"?
---

# The JAM stack is a new way of building websites and apps that are fast, secure and simple to work with.

JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markup. It's the fastest growing new stack for building websites and apps: no more servers, host all your front-end on a CDN and use APIs for any moving parts.
