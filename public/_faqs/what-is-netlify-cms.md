# Netlify CMS is Content Manager for Static Site Generators

Static sites are many times faster, cheaper and safer and traditional dynamic websites.

Modern static site generators like Jekyll, Middleman, Roots or Hugo are powerful publishing and development systems, but when we build sites for non-technical users, we need a layer on top of them.

Netlify CMS is there to let your marketing team push new content to your public site, or to let technical writers work on your documentation.

Netlify CMS integrates with Git and turns normal content editors into git comitters.
